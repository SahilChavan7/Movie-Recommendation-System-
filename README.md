🎥 Movie Recommendation System This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommendation System that predicts and suggests movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and interactions. The project employs machine learning techniques, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to deliver highly personalized recommendations.

✨ Features Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations based on user behavior and interactions.

Content-Based Filtering: Suggestions using movie metadata (genres, actors, directors, etc.).

Hybrid Approach: Combines user-based and item-based techniques for improved accuracy.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, normalizes inputs, and prepares datasets.

Scalability: Supports large datasets for real-world applications.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Dataset: MovieLens Dataset
